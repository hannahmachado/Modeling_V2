Modeling the Secondary visual cortex

  The ability to see and perceive is a result of a complex decoding system performed by the human brain. 
Once presented with stimuli, information travels to the visual cortex through a network of neurons, and its interpreted
by electrical synapses so we can make sense of the world around us. The visual cortex is divided in a hierarchy of cortical 
levels, meaning that different areas process different complexities of space that together decode the specific object and 
its surroundings. Much is known about the primary visual cortex (V1), an area highly responsible for the most basic kind of
information processing, such as spatial location and pattern recognition. Computationally speaking, V1  has a well defined
map of spatial processing, and many advances have evidences how the brain works in that area

  The secondary visual cortex, is at a higher cortical level and is the second largest area of the visual cortex. 
It remains uncertain, however, which differentiations are made in this cortex. This project seeks to propose a computational 
and mathematical model that encompasses the functionality of the secondary visual cortex. After understanding computationally 
how information travels to the brain and begins to be processed by neurons, and how it can be represented using deep 
convolutional neural networks and machine learning. I will use previous data gathered from Dr. Schwartzâ€™s lab, along with 
additional research, tol infer approaches for a computational model of the secondary visual cortex, as well as its 
functionality. The goal would be to obtain a functional model that encompasses the processing of information of V2. 
One of the importances of this approach is that by understanding how the brain acts on its healthy state, we are able 
to compare it to the abnormal, enlightening the way for novel methods of curing diseases linked to that area of the brain.
Besides that, the brain is in many ways a super computer, designed with many complex networks of neurons intertwined. 
The pathway and approach that the brain takes to process visual information can lead to insights on how to better model 
the pattern artificially, opening the way to new technological approaches. The faculty advising me in this project is 
Dr. Odelia Schwartz.
